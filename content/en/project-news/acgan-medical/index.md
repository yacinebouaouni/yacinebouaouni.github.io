One of the biggest challenges in the medical field is the limitations of the data quantity, especially for training classifiers based on neural networks. The objective of this project is to develop a GAN (AC-GAN) to generate both Covid and healthy X-ray images. The GAN is used to generate a dataset that will be used to train a classifier
