In this episode of The Happiness Legacy podcast, we chat with Rémi, a graduate student in psychiatry from McGill University (Montréal). Rémi is passionate about positive psychology and recently became a regional representative of the student-focused division of the International Positive Psychology Association (IPPA). We discuss priorities, motivation, healthy habits and more!
