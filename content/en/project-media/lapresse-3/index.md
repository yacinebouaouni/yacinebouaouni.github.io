La Presse journalist Catherine Handfield interviews Rémi Thériault, among others, on solidarity and individualism in times of post-COVID. "In the spring of 2020, the word 'solidarity' was in vogue in the media. We were all in the same boat against a common enemy: COVID-19. Almost two years later, are we back in the era of individualism? Or have we never even left it?"
