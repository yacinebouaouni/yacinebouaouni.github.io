Welcome to my blog! I'm Yacine, a dedicated machine learning engineer currently working with Valeo Applied Machine Learning Team. With a strong educational background from ENS Paris-Saclay and a Master's degree in Mathematics, Vision, and Learning (MVA), I have a deep understanding of the intricacies of this exciting field.

During my masters, I had the opportunity to intern at GoPro Paris, where I delved into the fascinating world of "Deep Learning Based Image Deblurring." This experience further fueled my passion for leveraging cutting-edge technologies to solve real-world problems. Prior to that, I successfully defended my engineering thesis on "Hybrid Deep Learning Based Speech Source Separation in the Time Frequency Domain" at Ecole Nationale Polytechnique.

Passion drives me in exploring the vast applications and theories of machine learning, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech processing. I remain at the forefront of advancements in these fields, always keeping a close eye on state-of-the-art machine learning methods.

In this blog, I aim to share my knowledge and experiences with you. Expect to find a diverse range of captivating topics, including project showcases, insightful notes, and thought-provoking articles. My goal is to provide valuable resources that will help both beginners embarking on their machine learning journey and seasoned practitioners seeking to stay updated with the latest advancements.

I invite you to join me on this exciting and ever-evolving journey through the world of machine learning. Together, we will explore, learn, and unlock the true potential of this remarkable field.
